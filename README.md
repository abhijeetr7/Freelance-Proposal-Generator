# Freelance-Proposal-Generator

This document provides a complete, self-contained HTML file. It uses Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design, and includes JavaScript for the proposal generation logic, copying to clipboard, downloading as PDF (using jsPDF), and sharing via URL.

Key Features Implemented:

Project Type Selector: A dropdown allows you to choose the type of project, influencing the template used.

Reusable Templates: Different templates are stored in JavaScript and dynamically populated with your input.

Download as PDF: A button to download the generated proposal as a PDF file.

Share via Link: Generates a URL that, when opened, pre-fills the form with your current input, allowing for easy sharing.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.

You can copy this code and save it as index.html to run it in your browser. Feel free to modify the templates or add more questions!
